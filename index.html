  <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>My name is Shati Khan and I’m a New York City-based transportation planner and aspiring plant lady. As a native New Yorker, I’ve always been passionate about urban systems and am excited to be working to improve the New York City transit landscape.
    <br>
    <br>Beyond urban planning, my interests are many and varied. I’ve always had a “passion for fashion” (blech), love museums and traveling like most other millennials, and am always	looking for a Korean language buddy! 
    </p>
  <h3>Why The Mighty Friend?</h3>
    <p>The Mighty Friend is actually a misnomer! I came up with the name back in college when a 	friend told me that my last name, Khan, meant “mighty” (disclaimer: it does not). Combined 	with my first name, Shati, which actually means ‘friend’ in Bengali, we get The Mighty Friend!
